- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PatrickE from Belgium, Europe, allround Windows systems administrator since the early 1990's and developer since the early 1980's.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m (still) interested in coding and automating day-to-day mundane tasks for Windows systems administrators.
I'm planning to make available to the wider community a small range of useful wide-scope tools that I developed in my 10 past years of day-to-day Windows network administration.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...   at this moment I am preferring to not be reachable directly but this may change in the future.
Please use the available GitHub communication features for now to get in touch.
